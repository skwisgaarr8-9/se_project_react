# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

This project is the tenth project in Practicum's Software Engineering course. It is the first iteration of a project that will span several sprints. It is the first project in which I have used React. Using functional components, I render a webpage that, upon intial render, makes an API request to a weather service, parses the weather data, and displays information on the page. The page displays the current temperature and suggests clothing items from a preset list of clothing items.

## Technologies and Techniques

- Semantic HTML
- CSS flexbox
- React Functional Components
- API requests
- Webpack

## Future Plans

I will continue to update this project over the coming sprints. Functionality to add clothing cards and possibly like clothing cards will be added. I would also like to add form validation and for the weather card to dynamically change depending on the weather.
